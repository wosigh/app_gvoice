dkGoogleVoice allows you to integrate the contacts on your phone with the Google Voice service.  You can place a call or send a text message by dialing a number on the dialpad or keypad, clicking on a history list item, or choosing a contact stored on your phone.  This application also allows you to read a recent list of your missed, incoming, and placed calls to your Google Voice number as well as text messages sent to that number.  If you missed a call to your Google Voice number, you can read the voicemail transcript that Google Voice provides by selecting the desired voicemail item.
